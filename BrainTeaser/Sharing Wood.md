## Question
A. B & C live together and share everything equally. One day A brings home 5 logs of wood, B brings 3 logs and C brings none. Then they use the wood to cook together and share the food. Since C did not bring any wood, he gives $8 instead. How much to A and how much to B?

## Answer
share everything equally
$$\text{avg} = \frac{8}{3}$$

$$\text{A1} = 5 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{7}{3}$$ 
$$\text{B1} = 3 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$$

so 
A get $7, B get $1
